      An Efficient and Flexible FPGA-Based Deep Neural Network Accelerator.
    </div>

    <div class="pub-authors">
     Designed a modular FPGA-based accelerator for convolutional neural networks,
      achieving approximately <strong>50%</strong> resource reduction and up to <strong>40x</strong> 
      efficiency improvement compared to conventional DSP-based designs. The architecture was 
      scaled to deliver up to 144 GOPS and 480 FPS with low power consumption, enabling efficient 
      AI deployment on edge devices.
